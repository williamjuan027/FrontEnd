# Frontend Mentor - DSIGN Landing Intro Challenge

![Design by Mubin ul haq Vhora for the DSIGN Landing Intro Challenge](./design/dsign-header-intro.jpg)

Design by: [Mubin ul haq Vhora](http://mubinulhaq.com/)

Welcome! Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. 

Your task is to build out the project to the design inside the `/design` folder. You only need to build 
the section that the design shows, you are not expected to add multiple pages or extra sections.

The challenge does not require any JavaScript and **should not include any front-end frameworks/libraries**.

If you decide to push the project live, tweet **@frontendmentor** once you're finished with your URL in the tweet. I'd love to take a look at what you've built!

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any regarding this challenge please email me at matt[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

Have fun building!
